Nested Statements and Scope
Now that we have gone over writing our own functions, it's important 
to understand how Python deals with the variable names you assign. 
When you create a variable name in Python the name is stored in a 
name-space. Variable names also have a scope, the scope determines 
the visibility of that variable name to other parts of your code.
