datetime module
Python has the datetime module to help deal with timestamps in 
your code. Time values are represented with the time class. 
Times have attributes for hour, minute, second, and microsecond. 
They can also include time zone information. The arguments to 
initialize a time instance are optional, but the default of 0 
is unlikely to be what you want.
