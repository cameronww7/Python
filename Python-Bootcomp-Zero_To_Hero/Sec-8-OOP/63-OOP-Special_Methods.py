We've learned that while functions can take in different arguments, 
methods belong to the objects they act on. In Python, polymorphism 
refers to the way in which different object classes can share the 
same method name, and those methods can be called from the same 
place even though a variety of different objects might be passed 
in. The best way to explain this is by example:
"""

print("\n63-OOP-Special_Methods\n")
print("- - - - - - - - - - ")
