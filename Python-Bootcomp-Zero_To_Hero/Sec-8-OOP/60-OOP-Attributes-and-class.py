Object Oriented Programming
Object Oriented Programming (OOP) tends to be one of the major obstacles 
for beginners when they are first starting to learn Python.

There are many, many tutorials and lessons covering OOP so feel free to 
Google search other lessons, and I have also put some links to other 
useful tutorials online at the bottom of this Notebook.

For this lesson we will construct our knowledge of OOP in Python by 
building on the following topics:

Objects
Using the class keyword
Creating class attributes
Creating methods in a class
Learning about Inheritance
Learning about Polymorphism
Learning about Special Methods for classes
