Booleans

Python comes with Booleans (with predefined True and False displays 
that are basically just the integers 1 and 0). It also has a 
placeholder object called None. Let's walk through a few quick 
examples of Booleans (we will dive deeper into them later in this course).

# Set object to be a boolean
a = True


#Show
print(a)

# Output is boolean
print(1 > 2)


# None placeholder
b = None

# Show
print(b)
