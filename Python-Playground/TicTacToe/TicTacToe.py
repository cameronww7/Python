Your assignment: Create a Tic Tac Toe game. You are free to use any IDE you like.

Here are the requirements:

2 players should be able to play the game (both sitting at the same computer)
The board should be printed out every time a player makes a move
You should be able to accept input of the player position and then place a symbol on the board
Feel free to use Google to help you figure anything out (but don't just Google 
"Tic Tac Toe in Python" otherwise you won't learn anything!) Keep in mind that this project 
can take anywhere between several hours to several days.

There are 4 Jupyter Notebooks related to this assignment:

This Assignment Notebook
A "Walkthrough Steps Workbook" Notebook
A "Complete Walkthrough Solution" Notebook
An "Advanced Solution" Notebook
I encourage you to just try to start the project on your own without referencing any of 
the notebooks. If you get stuck, check out the next lecture which is a text lecture with 
helpful hints and steps. If you're still stuck after that, then check out the Walkthrough 
Steps Workbook, which breaks up the project in steps for you to solve. Still stuck? Then 
check out the Complete Walkthrough Solution video for more help on approaching the project!

There are parts of this that will be a struggle...and that is good! I have complete faith 
that if you have made it this far through the course you have all the tools and knowledge 
to tackle this project. Remember, it's totally open book, so take your time, do a little 
research, and remember:
